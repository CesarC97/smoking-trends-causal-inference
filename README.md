## Introduction
Tobacco use remains one of the leading preventable causes of disease and death in the United States. Understanding long-term trends in adult tobacco consumption is essential for evaluating the effectiveness of public health policies, identifying emerging risks, and guiding future interventions. This project explores the question: Has adult smoking been decreasing over the years in the United States? by analyzing national consumption data from 2000 to 2023.

Using Python for exploratory data analysis and R for statistical inference, this study investigates patterns in both combustible tobacco products (e.g., cigarettes, cigars) and smokeless tobacco (e.g., chewing tobacco, snuff). The analysis focuses on total and per capita consumption over time, aiming to assess whether adult smoking habits have increased, decreased, or shifted toward alternative products.

## Ethical Considerations
This project uses publicly available, de-identified data sourced from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), ensuring individual privacy is fully protected. While statistical analysis can illuminate population-level trends, itâ€™s essential to recognize that behind these numbers are real people whose health behaviors are shaped by complex social, economic, and cultural factors. This analysis avoids moral judgment and aims to contribute objectively to the broader public health discussion on tobacco control, addiction, and health equity.

## Data Description
This dataset highlights critical trends in adult total and per capita consumption of both combustible (cigarettes, little cigars, small cigars, pipe tobacco, roll-your-own tobacco) tobacco products and smokeless (chewing tobacco and snuff) tobacco from 2000 to 2023.
